
Pacific Magazines is a magazine publisher operating in Australia, owned by Seven West Media.[1]

Pacific publishes leading titles including Australia's best selling magazine Better Homes & Gardens and the nation's leading fashion brand Marie Claire.

It has it roots in the Southdown Press, the publishers of New Idea and long owned by the Murdoch family. When News Corp Australia acquired the Herald and Weekly Times in 1987, the Australasian and Argus titles (Australasian Post, Home Beautiful, Your Garden) were added.  Rupert Murdoch spun off his Australian magazine holdings in 1991 into a new company, Pacific Magazines and Printing (PMP). Seven Media Group acquired Pacific Magazines in 2002, leaving PMP as solely a printing business. Two years later, Seven bought Murdoch Magazines, a former corporate sibling in News Corp Australia, from Matt Handbury.[2]

In 2016, Pacific Magazines took its digital assets back from Yahoo7 and subsequently launched multiple digital products across Fashion, Entertainment and Home & Food.[3]

In 2017, Pacific unveiled its all new "premium user experience" digital offerings for Marie Claire and Women's Health.[4]
