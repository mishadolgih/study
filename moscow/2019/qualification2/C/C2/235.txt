The series' title is derived from the Lady Gaga song of the same name.[citation needed] The original Just Dance game was released on the Wii in 2009 in North America, Europe, and Australia.[1]

Just Dance is a motion-based dancing game for multiple players, with each game featuring a collection of songs each with their own dance choreographies. During each song, players mirror a dance performed by actors on the screen, following commands that appear on the screen, and are awarded for their accuracy. Additionally, there are gold moves in which players must strike a pose in order to earn bonus points. Players are given ranks based on how well they do. Depending on the game and system it is played on, the game can be played with either motion controllers or camera devices (such as the Wii Remote and Kinect), or can download a Just Dance Now app to play with their smart device.

Just Dance Unlimited: Just Dance Unlimited is a subscription-based service on Just Dance 2016, Just Dance 2017, Just Dance 2018 and Just Dance 2019 which replaced downloadable content. It features over 150 Just Dance hits, with new exclusive songs including "Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)" by OMI, "Better When I'm Dancin" by Meghan Trainor, "Shut Up and Dance" by Walk the Moon and many more.

On January 14, 2019, Deadline reported that Screen Gems has acquired motion picture rights to Just Dance with Jason Altman and Margaret Boykin from Ubisoft Film and Television set to produce alongside Jodi Hildebrand and Will Gluck of Olive Bridge Entertainment.[13]
