There are three classifications of local government in Western Australia:

The Shire of Christmas Island and the Shire of Cocos (Keeling) Islands are Federal external territories and covered by the Indian Ocean Territories Administration of Laws Act which allows the Western Australian Local Government Act to apply "on-Island" as though it were a Commonwealth act. Nonetheless, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are not part of Western Australia.

Historically, two types of local government existed –  municipalities, which represented towns or condensed urban areas, and road districts, which represented all other regions. For instance, the Perth Road District was the precursor to the City of Stirling. Only a few cities –  Perth, Fremantle, Subiaco, South Perth and Nedlands –  existed prior to 1961. On 1 July 1961, all road districts became shires, and all municipalities became towns.
