"Robin (The Hooded Man)", the title theme from the series, was also released on a 7-inch single in 1984, featuring actor Michael Praed as Robin of Sherwood on the sleeve. The single was then re-released in 1986 with a newly recorded version and featuring actor Jason Connery on the sleeve. For this re-release, the B-sides include "Caisleán Óir" (as it appears on the album Macalla), which originally appeared slightly different as incidental music in the series. In addition, "Now Is Here" and "Scarlet Inside" were released as singles in their own right.

In addition to the tracks on Legend, which were used extensively in the series, music composed for the show was occasionally released elsewhere in different versions. These included a new version of "Caislean Oir" on Clannad's Macalla album (released 1986), and two live performances entitled "Robin of Sherwood Medley" and (portions of) "Dance & Teidhir Abhaile Riu" from Clannad: Live in Concert (released 2005). Another theme from the series was reworked as the song "Almost Seems (Too Late to Turn)".

In a statement posted in November 2003 on their official web site, Clannad revealed that,

Both sets 1 and 2 of the Blu-ray release and the European DVD release of Robin of Sherwood have a "music only" track for many of the episodes. This allows listeners to hear music not included on "Legend" from the first and second series, as well as the additional music recorded after the release of Legend, to be heard on their own.
