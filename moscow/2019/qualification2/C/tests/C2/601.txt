
"Je suis un vrai garçon" ("I Am a Real Boy") was the French entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1994, performed in French by Nina Morato. The song was performed twenty-fifth on the night, following Poland's Edyta Górniak with "To nie ja". At the close of voting, it had received 74 points, placing 7th in a field of 25.

The song features Morato singing that she does not wish to return to her lover, although she knows that he has feelings for her. She describes herself as "a real boy, the one who bewitches you". The song is in part memorable for Morato's idiosyncratic performance (an excerpt of which was shown during the Congratulations special in late 2005), which featured her leaping around the stage. It is also significant for the lyrics in the final chorus - the French running "Je sais j'suis son amour, mais putain, y'a des jours/Où c'est lourd, c'est lourd". The word "putain" - literally "whore" - can also be rendered as "fuck", (translated: "I know I'm his love, but fuck, there are days/When it's hard, it's hard") which clearly violates the Contest's rules on audible obscenities.[1] Nonetheless, the song was performed as written, profanities included.

It was succeeded as French representative at the 1995 Contest by Nathalie Santamaria with "Il me donne rendez-vous".
