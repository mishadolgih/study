In 2013, the company's largest selling product lines were Neulasta/Neupogen, two closely related drugs used to prevent infections in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy; and Enbrel, a tumor necrosis factor blocker used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

Amgen, which is one of the world's largest biotechnology companies, was established in Newbury Park, California in 1980, where its world headquarters are located.[4][5] It had 5,125 employees in Thousand Oaks as of 2017, which made up 7.5% of the city's total employment.[6] It is the largest employer in Ventura County.[7][8] Amgen has attracted hundreds of scientists to the Newbury Park area. Focused on the cutting edge of molecular biology and biochemistry, its goal is to provide a healthcare business based on recombinant DNA technology.[9]

The word AMGen is a portmanteau of the company's original name, Applied Molecular Genetics, which became the official name of the company in 1983 (three years after incorporation and coincident with its initial public offering). The company's first chief executive officer, from 1980, was co-founder George B. Rathmann, followed by Gordon M. Binder in 1988,[10] followed by Kevin W. Sharer in 2000.[11] Robert A. Bradway became Amgen’s president and chief executive officer in May 2012 following Sharer's retirement.[12]
