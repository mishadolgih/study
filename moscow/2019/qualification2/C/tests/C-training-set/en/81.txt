They are also developing their very first self-developed VR multiplayer online game with an open world setting, which is called Nostos.[8]

The company was founded in June 1997 by Chinese entrepreneur Ding Lei, and grew rapidly due in part to its investment in search engine technology[9] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming.

NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[25] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.

NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[26]

NetEase's official website address is 163.com. This was attributed to the past where Chinese internet users had to dial "163" to connect to the internet, before the availability of broadband internet.[27]
