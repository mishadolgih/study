He was first educated at Opaki Primary School and then Wairarapa College where he was a member of the 1st XV in 1956.[3]

Lochore played domestic rugby for Masterton and Wairarapa, debuting for both in 1959. After playing six tests, including all four tests of the 1965 South African tour of New Zealand, he was selected as captain by coach Fred Allen for the Lions tour in 1966. He continued as captain until his retirement from playing in 1970 (although at the selectors request he returned to play one game in 1971 for an injury-hit All Black side).

His involvement in the game did not end with his playing days. He coached Masterton before moving on to coach Wairarapa-Bush  in 1980. Lochore became an All Black selector in 1983 before taking the side to victory in the inaugural World Cup during his coaching tenure from 1985 to 1987. Lochore continued to be involved in All Black rugby, firstly managing the team in the 1995 World Cup, and later as one of the All Black selectors. He currently chairs the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust.[4]

Lochore was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to rugby football in the 1970 Queen's Birthday Honours.[5] In the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to sport and the community.[6]

The Lochore Cup, contested in New Zealand's domestic competition, the Heartland Championship, is named in his honour.[7] On Waitangi Day (6 February) 2007, Lochore was inducted into the Order of New Zealand as an additional member; the Order of New Zealand is the country's highest honour.[8]

In his biography, Sir Colin Meads wrote: "at the peak of his career, from 1966 through to 1969, he was everything I would want in a number 8. He spared himself, not an ounce working away in the tight-loose, covering, winning us great lineout ball in the deep, backing and filling and playing his part in the rolling drive-and-feed. As a captain he could be self-effacing, for this was the very nature of the man".[3]

Lochore was also a Wairarapa tennis representative from 1957 to 1961 and then 1979 to 1980.[3]
